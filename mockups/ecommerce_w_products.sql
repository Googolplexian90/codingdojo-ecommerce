Lead songwriter Tuomas Holopainen has referred to it as the \"album that saved his life\".[1]\n\nThe first single, \"Eva\", was leaked on the Internet six days before its official release, prompting the band to release the single earlier to boost downloads. Several other versions of the song were posted on YouTube and torrent sites a month later; the entire album with record label voiceovers had been leaked on the Internet by 2 August. The full album (without voiceovers) was leaked on 21 September 2007, as a result of several stores in Mexico selling the retail album much prior to the worldwide release date.',10.99,6,'nightw-darkpa_08.jpg','2015-03-26 02:05:30','2015-03-26 02:05:30'),(3,'Nightwish','Imaginaerum','Imaginaerum is the seventh studio album by Finnish symphonic metal band Nightwish.[2] According to Nightwish songwriter Tuomas Holopainen, the album is a concept album that tells the story of an old composer who is reminiscing of his youth on his deathbed.

Developed as a simultaneous audio-visual medium, Beyoncé \'​s songs are accompanied by non-linear short films that illustrate the musical concepts conceived during production. Its dark, intimate subject material includes feminist themes of sex, monogamous love and relationship issues, inspired by Beyoncé\'s desire to assert her full creative freedom.\n\nThe album\'s initial recording began in New York, where Beyoncé invited producers and songwriters to live with her for a month. During extensive touring the following year, the album changed as she conceived of creating a visual accompaniment to its songs and resumed recording sessions with rock musician Boots. Their collaboration led to more sonically experimental material, which combined rhythm and blues with electronic and soul music. Throughout this period, the album\'s songs and videos were composed in strict secrecy as Beyoncé devised an unexpected release.',9.99,11,'beyonc-beyonc_17.jpg','2015-03-26 02:05:30','2015-03-26 02:05:30'),(10,'Beyoncé','4',' is the fourth studio album by American recording artist Beyoncé, released on June 24, 2011, by Parkwood Entertainment and Columbia Records. Following a career hiatus that reignited her creativity, Beyoncé was inspired to create a record with a basis in traditional rhythm and blues that stood apart from contemporary popular music. Her collaborations with songwriters and record producers Terius \"The-Dream\" Nash, Christopher \"Tricky\" Stewart and Shea Taylor produced a mellower tone, developing diverse vocal styles and influences from funk, hip hop and soul.\n\nSevering professional ties with father and manager Mathew Knowles, Beyoncé eschewed the music of her previous releases in favor of an intimate, personal album. 4 \'​s lyrics emphasize monogamy, female empowerment and self-reflection, a result of Beyoncé considering a maturer message to contend artistic credibility. The album was praised by critics for its fusion of various genres and her strong vocal ability; many publications included it on their year-end lists.',9.99,6,'beyonc-4_10.jpg','2015-03-26 02:05:30','2015-03-26 02:05:30'),(11,'Beyoncé','I Am... Sasha Fierce','I Am... Sasha Fierce is the third studio album by American recording artist Beyoncé. It was released on November 15, 2008, by Music World Entertainment and Columbia Records. In its initial release, the album was formatted as a dual disc, intending to market Beyoncé\'s contrasting facets of artistry. The first disc, I Am..., contains slow and midtempo pop and R&B ballads, while the second, Sasha Fierce (named after Beyoncé\'s on-stage alter ego), focuses on more uptempo beats that blend electropop and Europop genres. In composing the songs\' lyrics, Beyoncé worked with many writers, with each session accompanied by live orchestration.\n\nBeyoncé credited both her husband, rapper Jay-Z, and jazz singer Etta James for inspiring her to push the limits of her songwriting and artistry. Musically, I Am... drew inspiration from folk and alternative rock, while blending acoustic guitar elements into contemporary ballads. The tracks on the first disc were written and produced by Beyoncé, during collaborative efforts with Kenneth \"Babyface\" Edmonds, Christopher \"Tricky\" Stewart, Terius \"The-Dream\" Nash and Ryan Tedder. Sasha Fierce boasted production from Rodney \"Darkchild\" Jerkins and Sean \"The Pen\" Garrett. The album received generally lukewarm reviews from critics, many of whom felt that it does not properly differentiate the double-discs contrasts and goals.',12.99,23,'beyonc-iamsas_23.jpg','2015-03-26 02:05:30','2015-03-26 02:05:30'),(12,'Beyoncé','B\'Day','B\'Day is the second studio album by American recording artist Beyoncé; it was released to coincide with her twenty-fifth birthday on September 4, 2006 by Columbia Records in collaboration with Music World Music and Sony Urban Music. The record was originally planned as a 2004 follow-up to Beyoncé\'s debut studio album Dangerously in Love (2003), although it was delayed to accommodate the recording of Destiny\'s Child\'s final studio album Destiny Fulfilled (2004) and her starring role in the film Dreamgirls (2006). While on vacation after filming Dreamgirls, Beyoncé began contacting various producers; she rented Sony Music Studios, and completed B\'Day in three weeks. Most of the lyrical content of the album was inspired by Beyoncé\'s role in the film. The album\'s musical style ranges from 1970s–80s funk influences and balladry to urban contemporary elements such as hip hop and R&B. Live instrumentation was employed in recording most of the tracks as part of Beyoncé\'s vision of creating a record using live instruments.\n\nUpon its release, B\'Day received generally positive reviews from most music critics and has since earned Beyoncé several accolades, including the Grammy Award for Best Contemporary R&B Album at the 2007 Grammy Awards. The album debuted at number one on the US Billboard 200 chart, selling 541,000 copies in its first week, the second-highest debut-week sales of Beyoncé.',9.99,13,'beyonc-bdayde_06.jpg','2015-03-26 02:05:30','2015-03-26 02:05:30'),(13,'Bob Marley','Confrontation','Confrontation is a Roots reggae album by Bob Marley & the Wailers, released posthumously in May 1983, two years after Marley\'s death. The songs on this album were compiled from unreleased material and singles recorded during Marley\'s lifetime. Many of the tracks were built up from demos, most notably Jump Nyabinghi where vocals from the I-Threes were added, which were not there when Marley released the song as a dubplate in 1979. In addition the harmony vocals on Blackman Redemption and Rastaman Live Up are performed by the I-Threes in order to give the album a consistent sound – on the original single versions they are performed by The Meditations. The most famous track on the album is \"Buffalo Soldier.\" Marley expressed the wish that \"I Know\" would be released as a single after his death, which Island Records obliged.',9.99,54,'bobmar-confro_06.jpg','2015-03-26 02:05:30','2015-03-26 02:05:30'),(14,'Bob Marley','Uprising','Uprising is a 1980 reggae album by Bob Marley and the Wailers. Marley died the following year, and Uprising was thus the final studio album released during his lifetime. This album is one of Marley\'s most directly religious, with nearly every song addressing his Rastafarian beliefs, culminating in the acoustic folk classic, \"Redemption Song\".\n\nUprising peaked at #41 on Billboard\'s (North America) Black Albums chart, and #45 on the Pop Albums chart. \"Could You Be Loved\" was #6 and #56 respectively on the Club Play Singles and Black Singles charts. The album fared better in the UK where it was a top ten hit along with the single \"Could You Be Loved\" which reached number 5 in the UK singles charts.',12.99,8,'bmarle-uprisi_03.jpg','2015-03-26 02:05:30','2015-03-26 02:05:30'),(15,'Bob Marley','Survival','Survival is a roots reggae album by Bob Marley & The Wailers released in 1979.\n\nSurvival is an album with an outwardly militant theme. Some speculate that this was due in part to criticism Marley received for the laid-back, ganja-soaked atmosphere of his previous release, \"Kaya\", which seemed to sidetrack the urgency of his message. In the song \"Africa Unite\", Marley proclaims Pan-African solidarity. The song \"Zimbabwe\" is a hymn dedicated to later-independent Rhodesia. The song was performed at Zimbabwe\'s Independence Celebration in 1980, just after the official declaration of Zimbabwe\'s independence. \"Zimbabwe\" is seen as an unofficial national song.\n\nSurvival was originally to be called Black Survival to underscore the urgency of African unity, but the name was shortened to prevent misinterpretations of the album\'s theme. Marley originally planned to release Survival as the first part of a trilogy, followed by Uprising in 1980 and Confrontation in 1983.\n\nIn South Africa the album was partly censored by the then white apartheid government.[3]',9.99,22,'bobmar-surviv.jpg','2015-03-26 02:05:30','2015-03-26 02:05:30'),(16,'Bob Marley','Kaya','Kaya is a roots reggae album released by Bob Marley and the Wailers in 1978. The album consists of tracks recorded alongside those present on the Exodus album in 1977. The album has a very relaxed, laid back sound, lacking much of the militant quality of the Wailers lyrically and musically. They received criticism for \'going soft\' as a result of the general sound of the album as well as the theme: songs primarily revolving around love, as well as marijuana. The album\'s release coincided with the One Love Peace Concert, heralding Marley\'s triumphant return to Jamaica from exodus in London. Many of the songs present on this album, as well as its sister album Exodus, are rerecorded versions of older tracks present on the album \"Soul Revolution Part II\" and the \"African Herbsman\" compilation album. Well known songs from the album include \"Is This Love\" and \"Satisfy My Soul\". Kaya reached the top five in the UK album charts.',12.99,9,'bobmar-kayawi.jpg','2015-03-26 02:05:30','2015-03-26 02:05:30'),(17,'Bob Marley','Exodus','Exodus is the ninth studio album by Jamaican reggae recording band Bob Marley and the Wailers, first released 3 June 1977 though Island Records. Following the disbandment of the groups original member\'s Marley was joined by a new backing band in which they released their first major success Rastaman Vibration (1976). On 3 December 1976, an assassination attempt was made on Bob Marley’s life in which his chest was grazed and his arm was struck, but he survived.[1] Following the assassination attempt Marley left Jamaica and was exiled to London where Exodus was recorded.[2]\n\nExodus is a reggae album, but it also incorporates elements of blues, soul, British rock and funk. The album\'s production has been characterized as laid-back with pulsating bass beats and an emphasis on piano, trumpet and guitar. Unlike previous albums from the Wailers, Exodus thematically moves away from cryptic story-telling; instead it revolves around themes of change, religious politics, and sex. The album is split into two halves: the first half revolves around religious politics while the second half is focused on themes of sex and keeping faith.\n\nThe album was a success both critically and commercially; receiving gold certifications in the US, UK and Canada. Exodus is widely considered to be the album that propelled Marley to international stardom.[1] In 2007 Exodus was remastered and re-released for its 30th anniversary. The re-release sparked new interest in the album, which many now argue is one of Marley\'s best works. Exodus has more tracks on Marley’s greatest hits album, Legend which is the highest selling reggae album of all time, than any of his other records.[1]',10.99,21,'bobmar-exodus_05.jpg','2015-03-26 02:05:30','2015-03-26 02:05:30'),(18,'Bob Marley','Rastaman Vibration','Rastaman Vibration is a reggae album by Bob Marley & The Wailers released on 30 April 1976.

Synthesizers are featured prominently on this album, adding a breezy embellishment to otherwise hard-driving songs with strong elements of rock guitar.

It is also the first album recorded with the I-Threes, a female vocal trio that included Bob\'s wife, Rita Marley, along with Marcia Griffiths and Judy Mowatt.\n\nNatty Dread peaked at No. 44 on Billboard\'s (North America) Black Albums chart, and at No. 92 on the Pop Albums chart.

I cried all the way to the bank.\"[31] (this phrase was already in use by the 1940s)[31] He sued the newspaper for libel,[53] testifying in a London court that he was not a homosexual and that he had never taken part in homosexual acts. He won the suit, partly on the basis of Connor\'s use of the derogatory expression \"fruit-flavoured\". The case partly hinged on whether Connor knew that \'fruit\' was American slang implying that an individual is a homosexual.[54] The £8,000 damages he received from the Daily Mirror led Liberace to repeat the catchphrase to reporters: \"I cried all the way to the bank!\"[55] Liberace\'s popularization of the phrase inspired the title of Crying All the Way to the Bank, a detailed report of the trial based on transcripts, court reports and interviews, by the former Daily Mirror journalist Revel Barker.',29.99,34,'liberace.jpg','2015-03-26 02:05:30','2015-03-26 02:05:30');
